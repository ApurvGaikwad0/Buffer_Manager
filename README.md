# Buffer_Manager
The goal is to implement a buffer manager that manages a fixed number of pages in memory (called page frames) for an existing page file. The buffer manager works in tandem with a storage manager from Assignment 1. Together, they form a **Buffer Pool**â€”a combination of a page file and a set of memory frames that cache disk pages.
